# Concept
Adopting the model of a Conference with large-scale talks targeted at the general audience but also breakout sessions that participants can sign-up for on an individualised manner.

**Emphasis on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD's ecosystem.**

Inspiration:
1. [AWS Summit](https://aws.amazon.com/summits/singapore/), upcoming  [Agenda for April](https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/singapore/agenda/techfest/)
2. [Fintech festival](https://fintechfestival.sg/)

## Objectives
1. Freshmores - understand the spaces (virtual and physical), avenues for resources and communities in SUTD in order to embody the desired culture

**Culture embodying the spirit of innovation, collaboration, having self-initiated projects, self-directed learning and broad-based skill integration**

2. SUTD - celebrate the work done by our research community, 5th rows and housing (specifically amongst seniors)

**Showcase the potential of UROPs and taking up research projects in SUTD, similar to LCC in an interactive/ experiential manner**

# Planning Parameters


|Key Information|
|--|
|Considering the constraints here, the goal of this team would be to set up sufficient channels for freshmores to have a sustained engagement during **Term 1**.
Rather than relying on mass sessions, to allow them to have a conceptual idea of what might be interesting/important to them and go for it.|

# Team Composition

## Collaboration
- ensure consistent tone throughout all efforts
- fair representation of the community
- must ensure conceptual integrity throughout the events and update key documents that represent this

## Communications
1. Visual branding (guide, logos for events, copy)
2. Announcement channel (and it's management)
3. Calendaring

**Let's ask for a budget for this rather than having to rely on heavy student involvement considering that it's Week 7**

## ! Stakeholder buy-in list 
1. Fablab 360 video along with tour guiding

## Establishing Conceptual Map
1. User Guide - Gitbook/Github Page/Wiki to explain the program
2. Static one-stop page to serve as event calendar

    - Fifth Row Guides
    - Communication channels for queries
    - Knowledge/skills
    - Contribution guides

## Student Life
1. Housing 
    - Getting to know the facilities that people can use
    - Getting to know people in your floor including seniors
    - Getting to know the academics that stay next door (but take note this must be a purely voluntary basis)

1. ! SAC usage and activities. Also to understand how one can [utilise](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/SAC-student-rules) it
1. Unified Fifth Row calendar for tryouts
1. One-stop Telegram message group for information
1. Human Library


## Theory of Change
![Key framework driving our theory of change](https://i.imgur.com/qULvsIt.png)
Taken from [A novel approach to onboarding](https://blog.hiri.com/a-novel-approach-to-onboarding-4a6c952a3e62)

|**IF**|**THEN**|
|---|---|
|We define our desired **culture** clearly and it's exhibited **behaviours**| A natural **transition** into university life may occur smoothly|
|Freshmores are introduced to **existing communities** or given the opportunity to start their own. Every Freshmore is **inducted into the people on their floors** and shown how the **spaces in Housing** may be used|The **gap** between freshmores and seniors may be better breached|
|Freshmores are prepared for upcoming projects with **tools, resources, meetups** to get inspiration from. This may result in a **guided project** that culminates in an actual product within the stipulated time|Freshmores will be able to **uncover their personal interests earlier** in the university journey|
|Freshmores need to be shown the **realities of working in SUTD** and have their expectations tempered to realistic levels and the urgency of taking on a project early|We will be able to **identify talented freshmores** to carry on key initiatives and culture-building exercises|
|Emphasise the **potential of projects** as a catalyst for growth|We will be able to **map the state of SUTD** on a yearly basis|


## Stakeholder Map
![StakeholderMap](https://i.imgur.com/BzY3y0K.png)
*Pillar Rooms meaning Learning Lab (ISTD), ESD Room, ASD Studios*

! Ensuring alignment with [Open House themes](https://openhouse.sutd.edu.sg/why-sutd/). Key objective to show them the embodiment of the 'why SUTD' statements.

1. Design-centric education focusing on human-centred solutions
2. Multi-discplinary curriculum to nurture future-ready graduates
3. Active, self-directed, collaborative and hands-on learning
4. Start-up atmosphere brimming with community spirit
5. Dedicated time to pursue your interests (Weds and Fri half days)

## Discovery Week 2018
![Discovery Week Timetable](https://i.imgur.com/ZNAXU9t.jpg)
 - Students lost interest quite quickly as they had no mental compass as to what events would be useful
 - better aesthetic language would be desired
 - students are looking for something to transition them into university life to help them cope with Freshmore term
 - 13 events spread over two days starting from 0930 and ending at 1630

## Other University orientation efforts:
1. USP academic camp - introduce to incoming scholars the culture expected in the programme
1. Renaissance engineering programme camp - they undergo a guided project during the camp that is meant to be hands-on

## Organisation employee orientation efforts:
1. Public Service Foundation Course (https://www.cscollege.gov.sg/programmes/pages/display%20programme.aspx?epid=vae3uj66l29irohmc3tpgfolam)
1. Valve’s employee handbook (https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)
