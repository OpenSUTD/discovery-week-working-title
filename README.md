# Discovery Week (Working Title)
**Decentralised planning for the Freshmore experience**

Check out [this page](https://open.sutd.dev/discovery-week-working-title/) for all the in depth details. You will even find out meeting minutes there! (it's under "Posts")

Do let us know if you can think of a better name for this event! That's why it's still a working title.

## What is this?
Discovery Week is a 3 week long introduction to the SUTD community. It will last from 22nd May - 7 June 2019. The event is hosted on Eventyay, powered by an Open Source Event server.

It is currently a working title because the name is still in the midst of being decided. Afterall, it’s a 3 week event and no longer just one week!

Discovery Week is organised by the team behind OpenSUTD.

OpenSUTD is modelled after the idea of an Open Organisation, and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good enviroment for members to learn and contribute effectively.

## Contributing
Details are [here](https://open.sutd.dev/discovery-week-working-title/contributing/).
In general the workflow is:
1. Submit a proposal through Github Issues on our master repository
2. We will reply to your issue and review it.
3. Once it is reviewed and cleared, you will get a notification.
4. If you’re proposing a session for the event, please proceed to Eventyay to submit your proposal. This is done to collate your details and to get ready to schedule you for the event. Otherwise, if you’re making a suggestion for improvement, the workflow will diverge and tailor to the idea given.
