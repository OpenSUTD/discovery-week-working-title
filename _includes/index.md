# What is this?
Discovery Week is a 3 week long introduction to the SUTD community. It will last from 22nd May - 7 June 2019.
The event is hosted on [Eventyay](https://eventyay.com/e/80f9d561/), powered by an Open Source Event server.

It is currently a [working title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title) because the name is still in the midst of being decided. Afterall, it's a 3 week event and no longer just one week!

Discovery Week is organised by the team behind [OpenSUTD](https://github.com/OpenSUTD).

OpenSUTD is modelled after the idea of an Open Organisation, and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good enviroment for members to learn and contribute effectively.
```
An Open Organization is one that engages participative communities both inside and out; responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act. -Open Organisation Definition
```

This is why we are making sure that our project documents are kept open so that **you** can be a part of this process.

# Concept
Adopting the model of a Conference with large-scale talks targeted at the general audience but also breakout sessions that participants can sign-up for on an individualised manner.

**Emphasis on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD's ecosystem.**

# Objectives
1. For Freshmores - understand the spaces (virtual and physical), avenues for resources and communities in SUTD in order to embody the desired culture
Culture embodying the spirit of innovation, collaboration, having self-initiated projects, self-directed learning and broad-based skill integration

2. For SUTD - celebrate the work done by our research community, 5th rows and housing (specifically amongst seniors)
Showcase the potential of UROPs and taking up research projects in SUTD, similar to LCC in an interactive/ experiential manner

# But what does this mean?
We will
1. **Support** Fifth Rows by providing a budget for you to hold workshops that cater to Freshmores. There's just a small catch, do follow the template we provide to facilitate preparing the event schedule.
2. **Organise** community sesions in the form of a Human Library, Lightning Talks and Housing events.
3. **Bring together** the larger graduate and research community in the SUTD ecosystem through tours and meet ups.
4. **Provide** a consistent visual branding throughout the event.
